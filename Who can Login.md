# Who can log in to CMRT Website?

### General Public, CMRT Members, CMRT Volunteers and CMRT Doners, etc.

The cmrailtrail.org.au website is publically available and there is no account login for general members, volunteers, doners, etc. 

As there is no additional data that is publically hidden there is no need for a provision for members, etc. to log in to an account to view such data. 

If someone notices a mistake on the website, then they may phone or e-mail a CMRT official to request a correction to the data. i.e. They don't have the ability to change the website. 

When receiving bulk e-mails from CiviCRM/Wordpress then the receiver has the right to request to have no further bulk e-mails set to them. This is performed by the receiver by checking a field on their received bulk mail. Alternatively they can ring a CMRT Official and request them to set no-bulk-email flag for this client/organization/contact.
