# Importing Individual Contacts.

## Introduction

The Importing of Contacts, either Individuals or Organisations, is perfomed by CiviCRM reading a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. The data in the CSV file is mapped to CiviCRM Fields.
In CiviCRM V6.2.0 the number of separate fields that CSV data can be imported to is about 80. The way CiviCRM is setup for CMRT, many of these fields are not used. 

Some fields are automatically generated by CiviCRM and don't need to be in the CSV file. For example, if the fields *Individual Prefix* = *Mr.*, *First Name* = *Joseph*, and *Last Name* = *Bloggs* then CiviCRM will automatically make the *Addressee* field to be *Mr. Joseph Bloggs*.

## Manually Massaging data in the CSV file.

* Change the CSV fields to match CiviCRM field. For example if a column header in the CSV file is *Surname*, then rename this to *Last Name* which is the name of the CiviCRM field. This allows CiviCRM to automatically match columns of CSV data to fields that CiviCRM already recognises.
* Fix the spelling and case of the CSV data. For many fields, *Title Case* is preferred. For example, if the CSV data for the *City* field is *KASTLEMAINE*, then change it to *Castlemaine*.
* Add the Nickname column to the CSV file. If someone has put their *First Name* as *William (Bob)*, then keep the *First Name* as *William* and add *Bob* to the *Nickname* column.

## Rules of Thumb
* Settings before actually doing the importing E.g Sub-contact.
* If a fields data contains a comma, then quote the whole field. E.g. If *Street Address* = *Unit 10, 123 Main St.* then  make it *Street Address* =  *"Unit 10, 123 Main St."*
* Load Organisation data before Individual data. This way Individual data can have the field *Employee of* and the name of the already registered organisation can be the data for this field.
