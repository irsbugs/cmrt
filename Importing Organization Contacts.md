# Importing Organization Contacts.

The information of an Organization may be imported via a csv file. It is helpful if the titles for each column in the csv file match names provided by CiviCRM. However data for every possible CiviCRM name is not required. This document highlights the fields which, hopefully, can be supplied with data about an organization.

If an Organizations contact record is exported, the csv file will have 85 fields. For importing the csv file about 50 matching fields are provided.

From the above, the following are considered to be *mandatory fields* as they are used to determine unique identification and avoid duplicate entries in the CiviCRM database.
```
Organisation Name
Email
Contact ID
External Identifier
```
The first time an organization is entered as a csv file, the `Contact ID` is automatically generated by CiviCRM. It is the incrementing sequential integer of all the contacts already entered. If a contact is deleted the record disappears, but the `Contact ID` number is never re-used.


For CMRT the aim for the minimum organization contact fields that data should be provided for are:
```
Contact ID 
Organisation Name *
Email *
External Identifier *
Contact Subtype
Legal Name
Nickname

```
* Mandatory
** Default data that is already loaded in the csv file.
