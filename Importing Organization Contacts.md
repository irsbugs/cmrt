# Importing Organization Contacts.

The information of an Organization may be imported via a csv file. It is helpful if the titles for each column in the csv file match names provided by CiviCRM. However data for every possible CiviCRM name is not required. This document highlights the fields which, hopefully, can be supplied with data about an organization.

If an Organizations contact record is exported, the csv file will have 85 fields. For importing the csv file about 50 matching fields are provided.

From the above, the following are considered to be *mandatory fields* as they are used to determine unique identification and avoid duplicate entries in the CiviCRM database.
```
Organisation Name
Email
Contact ID
External Identifier
```
The first time an organization is entered as a csv file, the `Contact ID` is automatically generated by CiviCRM. It is the incrementing sequential integer of all the contacts already entered. If a contact is deleted the record disappears, but the `Contact ID` number is never re-used.


For CMRT the aim for the minimum organization contact fields that data should be provided for are:
```
Contact ID 
Organisation Name *
Email *
External Identifier *
Contact Subtype
Legal Name
Nickname
Website
Phone
Phone Extension
Street Address
Supplemental Address 1
City
Post Code
State ** VIC
Country ** Australia
Communication Style ** Formal
Preferred Communication Method ** "Phone, Email"
Preferred Language ** en_AU
Contact Source **civicrm_organization_master_list.csv
```
* Mandatory fields
  
** Default data that is already loaded in the csv file.

Contact Subtype: Business, Community, Government - Federal, Government - Local - CGSC, Government - Local - MASC, Government - state

Note:
Duplicate Matching

If a contact in the import file appears to be a duplicate of an existing CiviCRM contact...

    Skip: Reports and then Skips duplicate import file rows - leaving the matching record in the database as-is (default).
    
    Update: Updates database fields with available import data. Fields in the database which are NOT included in the import row are left as-is.
    
    Fill: Fills in additional contact data only. Database fields which currently have values are left as-is.
    
    No Duplicate Checking: Inserts all valid records without comparing them to existing contact records for possible duplicates.

You can only match imported data directly to existing Contact IDs in Update, Fill or No Duplicate Checking modes.
