# Importing Organization Contacts.

The information of an Organization may be imported via a csv file. It is helpful if the titles for each column in the csv file match names provided by CiviCRM. However data for every possible CiviCRM name is not required. This document highlights the fields which, hopefully, can be supplied with data about an organization.

If an Organizations contact record is exported, the csv file will have 85 fields.
