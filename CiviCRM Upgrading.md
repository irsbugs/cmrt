# CiviCRM Upgrading

## Introduction

New releases of CiviCRM for WordPress occur about once a month. Although WordPress has an automatic facility to perform upgrades, the CiviCRM package is currently not designed to be automatically upgraded by WorPress.

Documents on performing an upgrade are:
* [Upgrading CiviCRM for WordPress](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/upgrade/wordpress/)
* [Upgrades](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/upgrade/)
