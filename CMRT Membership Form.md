## Introduction

At the top of the home page of cmrailtrail.org.au there is a button to: "Join us / Renew Membership" 

Upon clicking the button you are take to the page: https://cmrailtrail.org.au/product/1-year-individual-membership/

Note: For some reason there is and (un-needed) zoom feature on the image "1 Year Individual Membership"

On the top left is an image of 1 Year Individual Membership, on the right is the following introductory text:

```
1 Year Individual Membership (with Donation optional)

$15.00 – $65.00Price range: $15.00 through $65.00

Annual membership is $15 p.a and is valid for 12 months from purchase.

Membership helps you shape the path to a trail:

* get really involved
* keep us strong
* have your say
* exercise your vote
* special member events
* become a volunteer (we hope!)

If you volunteer – or donate – you have an even bigger impact!
We regard the work by our volunteers as a big enough donation already!

But if you think you’re going to be a bit too busy to volunteer, you may want to consider a donation to help those who are.

NOTE: Please include only 1 x membership application per transaction. We are obliged to record unique contact details for each of our members
