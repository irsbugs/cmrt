## Introduction

At the top of the home page of cmrailtrail.org.au there is a button to: "Join us / Renew Membership" 

Upon clicking the button you are taken to the page: https://cmrailtrail.org.au/product/1-year-individual-membership/


## Page: https://cmrailtrail.org.au/product/1-year-individual-membership/

Note: For some reason there is and (un-needed) zoom feature on the image "1 Year Individual Membership"

On the top left is an image of 1 Year Individual Membership, on the right is the following introductory text:

```
1 Year Individual Membership (with Donation optional)

$15.00 – $65.00Price range: $15.00 through $65.00

Annual membership is $15 p.a and is valid for 12 months from purchase.

Membership helps you shape the path to a trail:

* get really involved
* keep us strong
* have your say
* exercise your vote
* special member events
* become a volunteer (we hope!)

If you volunteer – or donate – you have an even bigger impact!
We regard the work by our volunteers as a big enough donation already!

But if you think you’re going to be a bit too busy to volunteer, you may want to consider a donation to help those who are.

NOTE: Please include only 1 x membership application per transaction. We are obliged to record unique contact details for each of our members

```

This is followed by the optional Donation with drop-down menu

```

Upon selecting a donation option:

* A field displays the total of the membership fee and the donation. E.g. $25.00
* The *Add to cart* button becomes highlighted.
* On hover over of the *Add to Cart* button a proceed arrow appears in the button at the end of the text "Add to cart".
* There is also the button *GPay*
  
Clicking on the *Add to cart* button this takes you the the page: https://cmrailtrail.org.au/cart/

At the base of the page is the following, (which seems to be internal information that should not be being displayed?):
