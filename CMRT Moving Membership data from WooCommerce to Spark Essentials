# Moving Membership Data from WooCommerce database to Spark Essential CiviCRM database

Steps and Considerations are along these lines:

* The WooComerce data is exported to a csv file. It contains both Contact Data (Email, First name, Last Name, etc.) and Membership data (Membership Start Date, Membership Renewing Date, etc.) for Spark CiviCRM

* The WooCommerce data needs to be split into two csv files, one with Contact data and one with Membership data.

* The Contact data should have the same fields as the future **New or Renew Membership** profile has in Spark. 

* If the Spark **New or Renew Membership** profile selects the *State of Australia* with a drop-down menu that contains the options: VIC, NSW, TAS, WA, SA, NT, QLD, ACT, then the data from WooCommerce needs to be checked / edited to ensure it uses the same abbreviations. E.g. If it states: Victoria, then change it to VIC.

* The Contact data for Spark CiviCRM uploading needs to have the Field *External Identifier* added to each record in the csv file. E.g. woo001, woo002, woo003

* The Contact data csv file is then loaded into Spark using the **Contacts --> Import Contacts** CiviCRM utility.

* The Membership data file needs to have the *Email* and *External Identifier* added in order to match/find the actual Contact in the database.  

* The Membership data csv file is then loaded into Spark using the **Memberships --> Import Memberships** CiviCRM utility.
